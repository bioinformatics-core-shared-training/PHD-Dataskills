### Open Refine practical (Please note that this is not a full course but is designed to demonstrate the value of this tool).
1. Download the [data-file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioinformatics-core-shared-training/PHD-Dataskills/master/example.csv?token=ADJJD7VXDDZ3ZXKAFI4KI4K5VGPLS) using a right-click download (Ctrl-click on Mac).
2. Run OpenRefine, create a new project and navigate to the example.csv file. OR should
be able to read it in with it's default options. Click to create project.
3. Experiment with scrolling through the file. How many rows and columns are there in the file? Can you spot any problems within the data?
4. Use text-facet function on the 'Drug' column. How many different drug names does OR find - Can you find any data entry problemsany issues with this facet?
5. More information on Cancer drugs [here](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs) listing generic and brand names. Try and rectify this issue and any spelling (or similar input) mistakes e.g. by using the cluster feature and trying different keyring functions. Does using these functions highlight any other non-spelling input issues? If so, have a go at fixing them.
6. Use a text facet to find out how many different units are recorded in the data.
With a bit more OR training it should be possible to achieve more homogeneous units by using advice like [this - see pages 6&7](https://www.fda.gov/media/72309/download).
